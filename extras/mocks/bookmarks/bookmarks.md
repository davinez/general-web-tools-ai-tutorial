# AI Prompt to generate mock file

Could you provide an exportable file of Chrome bookmarks? I need a file with 30 bookmarks to use as mock data for an app I'm developing. The app will receive the file, extract all the bookmarks, and map them to a list of objects. These objects will then be sent to an AI for processing in chunks and grouped based on title, URL, etc. Afterward, I'll generate a new bookmarks file to import into the browser, with bookmarks correctly grouped by domain. For this file, please include 10 bookmarks in a folder like root/generated folder, all related to one website. Then, at another level, root or other folders, add the remaining 20 bookmarks from various websites, some related and some not.
