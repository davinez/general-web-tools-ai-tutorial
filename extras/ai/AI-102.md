# Notes

AI solutions are built on machine learning models that encapsulate semantic relationships found in huge quantities of data; enabling applications to appear to interpret input in various formats, reason over the input data, and generate appropriate responses and predictions.

# Type of AI 

## Generative AI

Generative AI uses language models to respond to natural language prompts, enabling you to build conversational apps and agents that support research, content creation, and task automation 

The language models used in generative AI solutions can be large language models (LLMs) that have been trained on huge volumes of data and include many millions of parameters; or they can be small language models (SLMs) that are optimized for specific scenarios with lower overhead. 

Language models commonly respond to text-based prompts with natural language text; though increasingly new multi-modal models are able to handle image or speech prompts and respond by generating text, code, speech, or images.

# List Azure AI services

A set of out-of-the-box prebuilt APIs and models that you can integrate into your applications. The following table lists some commonly used Azure AI services

# How provisioned / create azure services ?

- Portal
- BICEP or ARM templates
- Azure command-line interface
- For most medium to large-scale development scenarios it's better 
use concentrate in an Azure AI Foundry project 
enabling centralize access control and cost management

# Regional availability

Some services and models are available in only a subset of Azure regions.


# Single service or multi-service resource ?

## Single Service

- Most Azure AI services, such as Azure AI Vision, Azure AI Language, and so on, 
can be provisioned as standalone resources.

- Standalone Azure AI services often include a free-tier SKU with limited functionality

- Each standalone Azure AI resource provides an endpoint and authorization keys to access it

## Multi-service

- Encapsulates multiple AI services in a single Azure resource

- We have 2 options types for multi-service: Azure AI services and Azure AI Foundry

# Azure AI services

- Azure AI services uses a single key and endpoint

# Azure AI Foundry

- Resource connections, data, code, and other elements of the AI solution in projects. (centralized)
- Azure AI Foundry portal, a web-based visual interface for working with AI projects. 
- Azure AI Foundry SDK, which you can use to build AI solutions programmatically


## Types of AI Foundry projects

- Foundry projects

-- Associated with an Azure AI Foundry resource in an Azure subscription. 
-- Foundry projects provide support for Azure AI Foundry models (including OpenAI models), 
Azure AI Foundry Agent Service, Azure AI services, and tools for evaluation 
and responsible AI development
-- More suitable for developers who want to manage resources for AI agent 
or chat app development. 


- Hub-based projects

-- Associated with an Azure AI hub resource.
-- Hub-based projects include an Azure AI Foundry resource, 
as well as managed compute, support for Prompt Flow development, and connected 
Azure storage and Azure key vault resources
-- We can also use Azure AI hub resources in both Azure AI Foundry portal 
and Azure Machine learning portal, making it easier to work on collaborative 
projects that involve data scientists and machine learning specialists as 
well as developers and AI software engineers
-- More suitable for enterprise development teams working on complex AI solutions.

# Developer tools and SDKs

- Azure AI Foundry for VS Code extension:
Creating a project.
Selecting and deploying a model.
Testing a model in the playground.
Creating an agent.

- GitHub and GitHub Copilot

- The Azure AI Foundry Models API, which provides an interface for 
working with generative AI model endpoints hosted in Azure AI Foundry.

- The Azure OpenAI in Azure AI Foundry Models API, 
which enables you to build chat applications based on OpenAI models hosted 
in Azure AI Foundry.
* Using API POST like GEMINI for .NET, if there is no proper SDK

* Difference 
* The Model Inference API primarily concerns the consumption of predictions 
from a wide range of foundational models.
* The Foundry Models API focuses on AI agents and also includes Azure OpenAI 
and other compatible models for agent-based applications.

- Azure AI Services SDKs, AI service-specific libraries for 
multiple programming languages and frameworks that enable you to consume 
Azure AI Services resources in your subscription. 

- The Azure AI Foundry SDK, which enables you to write code to connect to 
Azure AI Foundry projects and access resource connections, 
which you can then work with using service-specific SDKs.

- The Azure AI Foundry Agent Service, which is accessed through the 
Azure AI Foundry SDK and can be integrated with frameworks 
like *Semantic Kernel* to build comprehensive AI agent solutions.


# Responsible AI

Probabilistic models, which are in turn dependent on the data with 
which they were trained.

- Fairness, should treat all people fairly. Example, 
suppose you create a machine learning model to support a loan approval 
application for a bank. The model should make predictions of whether or not 
the loan should be approved without incorporating any bias based on gender, ethnicity, 
or other factors that might result in an unfair advantage or disadvantage to specific groups of applicants.

- Reliability and safety, a machine learning model that diagnoses 
patient symptoms and recommends prescriptions. 
Unreliability in these kinds of system can result in substantial 
risk to human life.


- Privacy and security
The machine learning models on which AI systems are based rely on large volumes 
of data, which may contain personal details that must be kept private. 
Even after models are trained and the system is in production, 
they use new data to make predictions or take action that may be subject 
to privacy or security concerns; so appropriate safeguards to protect data 
and customer content must be implemented.

- Inclusiveness
AI systems should empower everyone and engage people. 
AI should bring benefits to all parts of society, 
regardless of physical ability, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, 
or other factors.

- Transparency
AI systems should be understandable. Users should be made fully 
aware of the purpose of the system, 
how it works, and what limitations may be expected.

- Accountability
Designers and developers of AI-based solution should work within a framework 
of governance and organizational principles that ensure the solution 
meets responsible and legal standards that are clearly defined.
